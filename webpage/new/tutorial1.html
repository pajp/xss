	This tutoríal will describe the different aspects of
	developing Flash applications that are communicating with XSS
	in order to accomplish server-side tasks.

      <h2>Chapter 1: the simplest kind of communication</h2>
      <p>
	In this chapter, we will take a look at utilizing the basic
	built-in functionalities of XSS together with a simple Flash
	movie. You will need basic knowledge of handling Flash and
	ActionScript. It also helps to have a basic understanding of
	XML and XML programming (such as how the ActionScript XML
	object works).

      </p>
      <h3>1.1 Prerequisites</h3>
      <p>
	To run this example, we need no special XSS modules loaded. We
	will, however, use the BroadcastUnknownTags feature to let the
	Flash movies send XML to each other via the server.
      </p>
      <p>
	Throughout this tutorial, we will assume that the server is
	running in a Windows operating system, is installed in the
	directory <b>C:\XSS</b> and that the configuration file is
	called <b>config.xml</b> and located in that directory. These
	are also the defaults when installing XSS using the Windows
	installer.
      </p>
      <p>
	As mentioned in the first paragraph, we need to make sure that
	the BroadcastUnknownTags feature is enabled. To do that, open
	<b>C:\XSS\config.xml</b> with a text editor such as WordPad
	and locate a line looking something like this:
      </p>
<pre class="example">
    &lt;BroadcastUnhandledTags&gt;false&lt;/BroadcastUnhandledTags&gt;
</pre>
      <p>
	Simply change from <code>false</code> to <code>true</code>
	and then (re-)start the server.
      </p>
      <h3>1.2 Creating a GUI</h3>
      <p>
	We will now create the simplest possible chat. If you want to,
	you can just skim through this paragraph and download the
	sample file <a href="#sample-1">here</a>. <br/>

	Start Flash and create a new
	movie. Lay out two new text areas, one big for output, and a
	small one one for input. Accordlingly, in the Properties
	panel, set the text field type to "Dynamic text" for the
	bigger output field, and "Input Text" for the small input
	field. Also, we don't need to name the text fields themselves,
	but we need to associate them with an ActionScript
	variable. Enter "outputText" in the "Var:" box of the output
	fields properties, and similarly, enter "inputText" in the
	corresponding field for the input field. The last graphical
	element we'll add is a small button. We'll be lazy and use one
	of Flash's built-in. Open the "Window" menu and choose "Common
	Libraries" -&gt; "Buttons". I like the "Pill button" found in
	the "Component Buttons" folder. Drag it (or any other button
	you fancy) onto the scene. Finally, you might want to put
	borders around the text fields to make them visible. Select
	them, and click the "Show Border" toggle-button in the
	properties panel.

      </p>
      <p>
	<a name="sample-1"></a>
	Now, we have the bare GUI to start doing some scripting and
	connect to the server. You can find our version of the file <a
	  href="tutorial-flash/ch1-1.fla">ch1-1.fla</a> here.
      </p>
      <h3>1.3 Talking to XSS, part 1</h3>
      <p>
	Since this is a very
	simple Flash movie, we won't take much care to make it very
	structures. As for all the ActionScript, we'll create it in
	frame one on our only layer. Bring up the Actions panel for
	that frame and type:
      </p><pre class="example">
stop();
var socket = new XMLSocket();
var host = "localhost";
var port = 8085;
</pre>
      <p>
	The first line is just there to make sure the Flash movie
	doesn't start to animate in case we happen to add more frames.
	The remaining three lines defines the <code>socket</code>
	object, which we'll use to communicate with the server, and
	two variables, <code>host</code> and <code>port</code>, which
	decide where to reach the server. In our case, on the same
	machine as Flash is running on ("localhost"), and the standard
	XSS port 8085. Now, we'll go on and define a function to make
	it convenient for us to print out stuff on the big text area:
      </p>
<pre class="example">
function println(message) {
	outputText = outputText + message + "\n";	
}
</pre>
      <p>
	Now we'll add a function that takes care of connecting to the server:
      </p>
<pre class="example">
function setupConnection() {
	socket.onConnect = connectHandler;
	socket.onXML = xmlHandler;
	println("*** connecting to " + host + "...");
	socket.connect(host, port);	
}
</pre>
      <p>
	As you can see, it actually does a bit more than just connect
	to the server. It also sets up our handlers, or
	<i>callbacks</i>, that will be called by the Flash engine to
	notify us about connection details and incoming XML,
	respectively. We do that by assigning the
	<code>onConnect</code> and <code>onXML</code> properties of
	the socket object to function names of our own. These
	functions, <code>connectHandler</code> and
	<code>xmlHandler</code> haven't been defined yet. We're just
	about to do that, though:
      </p>
      <pre class="example">
function connectHandler(success) {
	if (success) {
		println("*** Connect OK!");	
	} else {
		println("*** Connection failed. Is server down?");	
	}
}
</pre>
      <p>
	The <code>connectHandler</code> function is pretty
	straight-forward; the Flash engine calls it when the
	connection to the server is up, or if it fails. To let us tell
	the difference, it is also kind enough to give us a parameter,
	which we have named <code>success</code>. This parameter will
	be <code>true</code> if everthing went OK, or
	<code>false</code> otherwise. So all we do here is check that
	variable and translate it into something user-friendly to
	print on the screen.
      </p>
      <p>
	The next function we need to program is the one handling
	incoming XML messages from the server, which we earlier named
	<code>xmlHandler</code>. Again, we'll keep it very simple, and
	only let it recognize one XML tag: <code>&lt;message/&gt;</code>.
      </p>
      <pre class="example">
function xmlHandler(document) {
	var element = document.firstChild;
	if (element.nodeName == "message") {
		println("Incoming message: " +
				element.attributes.text);
	} else {
		println("*** Unknown XML tag: " + 
				element.nodeName);
	}
}
</pre>
      <p>
	Like our <code>onConnect</code> callback (the function
	<code>connectHandler</code>), this one also receives one
	parameter from Flash. This may contain a bit more
	information: it contains the XML "document" (message) sent
	from the server. It comes in the form of an <code>XML</code>
	object. An XML object is the hierarchial representation of a
	document with XML data, with methods and properties to access
	and modify it. What interests us now is only the root element
	and, if it's name is "message", one of it's attributes,
	"text". Upon receipt of a &lt;message/&gt; tag, its "text"
	attribute is printed out in the output field. If the tags name
	isn't "message", a message is printed out telling the user
	that we didn't recognize what the server sent.
      </p>
      <p>
	Now, we'll add a single line calling our start function so
	that the connection is made when the Flash movie starts:
	<pre class="example">
setupConnection();
</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
	We now have everything set up to connect to the server as well
	as to read whatever it sends to us. To see what it all should
	look like this far, check <a
	  href="tutorial-flash/ch1-2.fla">the file ch1-2.fla</a>. The
	next step lets us actually use the server, too!
      </p>
      <h3>1.4 Talking to XSS, part 2:</h3>
      <p>
	To be able to send a
	message to the server, we'll have to assign a handler to the
	button we have created. We'll just do as we normally do in
	Flash, and assign a handler for the <code>release</code>
	event - just select the button and bring up its Actions panel,
	wherein you enter:
      </p>
      <pre class="example">
on (release) {
	_root.println("Sending message: " + _root.inputText);
	_root.sendMessage(_root.inputText);
	_root.inputText = "";
}
</pre>
      <p>
	All this action does is to call a function with the value
	of the <code>inputText</code> variable as a parameter, and
	then immediately clear that same label. Of course, the
	function it's calling - <code>sendMessage()</code> - hasn't
	been created yet. What it shall do is to take the message
	we've given it, contruct an XML "document" out of it, and send
	the document to the server. This is how it's done:
      </p>
      <pre class="example">
function sendMessage(msg) {
	var doc = new XML();
	var e = doc.createElement("message");
	e.attributes.text = msg;
	doc.appendChild(e);
	socket.send(doc);
}
</pre>
      <p>
	What we see here is the other end of handling a Flash XML
	object: here we're creating an XML document instead of just
	reading it, as we did in our <code>xmlHandler</code>
	function. We create just one tag, &lt;message/&gt;, with one
	attribute, "text", containing the data in our input text
	field.
      </p>
      <p>
	Now we are all set to send message to different Flash
	clients through the server! To see it in action, export the
	movie to an SWF file, and run multiple instances of it by
	double-clicking on it several times. If you write a text in
	one Flash movie and click the button, it will appear in the
	others, which will receive it through the server.
      </p>
      <h3>1.5 Summary and finishing notes</h3>
      <p>
	We have now completed the first chapter in this tutorial,
	which tought us the basic concepts and usage of the XML and
	XMLSocket object. We utilized the XSS
	<code>BroadcastUnhandledTags</code> feature to let all XML
	messages pass through the server to any other connected
	clients. As you can see, this is an easy way to quickly get
	Flash clients talk to each other.
	</p>
      <p>
	If you tried to use international characters, (for example the
	scandinavian "&aring;"), you probably noticed that they turn
	up weird on the receiving end. Don't worry, this is not a bug
	in the server. However, to use international characters you
	need to prefix all messages with an <i>XML declaration</i>,
	telling it what character set you are using. Flash is using
	UTF-8. To do this, add the following as the <i>second</i> line
	of our <code>sendMessage()</code> function (right after
	"<code>var doc = new XML();</code>"):
	</p>
	<pre class="example">
doc.xmlDecl = "&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?&gt;";
</pre>
      <p>
	Finally, our pre-cooked version of the result is available <a
	  href="tutorial-flash/ch1-3.fla">in the file ch1-3.fla</a>.
