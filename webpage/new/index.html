      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
	Bricole XSS is a server application primarily intended for use
	together with the Macromedia Flash feature <a
	href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/flash/action_scripts/objects/xmlsocket_object.html">XMLSocket</a>.
	XSS makes it easy to create server-side Java-based application
	that communicates with a Flash 5 movie through the use of a
	persistent TCP socket and XML. The module-oriented design of
	XSS lets developers extend its functionality to suit a rich
	number of applications.
	Javascript and database (JDBC) support
	makes it an ideal platform for rapid development of advanced
	client-server Flash applications. 
      </p>
      <p>
	XSS is free for non-commercial, educational and evaluation
	purposes. Commercial licensing is available on a per-server
	basis, and the fee is &euro;250 (excluding VAT),
	and includes new versions up to (but not including) 2.0.
	If you don't want to buy a license, you can also
	<a href="sales.html#subscription">subscribe</a> to an XSS
	server hosted by me through my hosting program. See the
	<a href="sales.html">sales page</a> for mor information!
      </p>
      <p>
	While the product still is in alpha stage, it is believed to
	be very stable. During the alpha development stages, we will
	refine the public APIs and make sure that getting started with
	XSS development will be easy and that the provided tools
	behave in a consistent way.
      </p>
      <h2>Version 0.9 (alpha)</h2>
      <p>
	  <b>Release date: September 21, 2003</b><br/>
	Bricole XSS 0.9 includes the following features:
      <h3>Database access</h3>
      <p>
	The Database access module lets a user access an SQL database
	with no programming required. SQL queries are defined in a
	property file and executed using pre-defined XML-tags
	&lt;db:executeQuery/&gt; and &lt;db:executeUpdate/&gt;. Their
	results are returned to the client, transformed into XML using
	the meta-data provided by the JDBC driver.
      </p>
      <h3>Javascript support</h3>
      <p>
	New XML tags can be defined using Javascript, and the scripts
	have access to the same Java objects as regular Java
	modules. The Javascript files are dynamically loaded when they
	are put in the defined folder, and reloaded if changed.
      </p>
      <h3>Authentication</h3>
      <p>
	A generic authentication module is included, allowing the user
	to define users and passwords in the XSS configuration
	file. The XSS authentication mechanism allows an
	<i>authentication domain</i> to be associated with a module,
	and will only let users authenticated to that domain access
	the modules protected by it. XSS provides both basic (plain
	text) authentication and a secure challenge-response MD5
	method which effectively protects the password from
	eavesdropping. The AuthHandler module API makes it easy to
	provide new authentication sources such as SQL user databases.
      </p>
      <h3>Chat</h3>
      <p>
        A simple chat module is provided, supporting private and
	public messages, user listing and user details.
      </p>
