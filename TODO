* Write package descriptions and introductory texts for the API docs
* Add support for the Java Logging API (feels important)
* Provide a mechanism to let modules register tags dynamically during
  their lifetime. That way the ECMAScript module wouldn't have to be a
  wildcard module and we can save us some unnecessary module calls.
* To bring it further, we provide an API to dynamically register new
  modules entirely.
* To bring it _even_ further, we should use our own class loader so
  that we can reload and undeploy modules on the fly.

* Documentation
  - The authentication mechanism
  - More examples (maybe how to use JDBC in FESI?)
  - err, a whole lot
* Persistent storage APIs


Done:

* Perhaps replace FESI with Rhino (<URL:http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/>)
