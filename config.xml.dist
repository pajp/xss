                <!-- The ECMAScriptModule provides JavaScript support by scanning

                     associate themselves with the tags they wish to handle.
                     This makes Javascript the easiest way to rapidly prototype
                     new XMLSocket application, being it is practically
                     zero-configuration.

                     The ECMAScriptModule supports three module properties:
                        * scriptDirectory
                          - Specifies where to look for the script files.
			  - If the directory isn't found, the module will look
			    for it in the same location as the config.xml
                        * autoReload
                          - Enables a time-stamp check on the script files,
                            making the server automatically reload a script if
                            it has been modified on disk since it was loaded.
                        * autoRescan
                          - Schedules a script directory rescan every
                            _autoRescanInterval_ seconds (see below), making
                            it possible to add new scripts without restarting
                            the server. It is not possible to remove a script
                            from memory without a server shutdown, though.
                        * autoRescanInterval
                          - Specifies the delay (in seconds) between each scan
                            of the script directory.
